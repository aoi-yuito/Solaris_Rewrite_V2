# Solaris
## A Discord bot designed to make your server a safer and better place.
Solaris was built using more than 2 years of bot building experience to be the definitive word in server security. Bundled with plenty of powerful features, and with many more planned for the future, it's been designed to do all the things other moderation bots don't.

## T&Cs just got interesting.
If you ever wished you could hire a bouncer for your server, Solaris might be just what you're looking for. Special thanks to those who helped me in building this bot. Note that this is just a re-written version of the original bot [Solaris](https://github.com/parafoxia/Solaris) and the original author of this project is [Parafoxia](https://github.com/parafoxia). Once again thank you very much if you liked my work!

- Make spam bots and excuses from rulebreaking members a thing of the past. A powerful gateway / verification system makes sure new members accept the rules before being able to talk in the server, and personally deals with those who don't.
- Add your own personal touch with tonnes of customisation options. Whether you want customisable messages, including separate messages for humans and bots, or the ability to set multiple member roles, Solaris has you covered.
- Get that peace of mind you deserve. With 24/7 uptime, and systems in place to make sure nothing goes amiss even if Solaris does go down, no new members will be left out.

## Giving you the power you need.
Solaris is bundled full of useful moderation commands to give you the power you need, when you need it.

These include some old favourites...
- `kick`, which kicks all the specified members from the server
- `ban`, which bans all the specified members from the server
- `unban`, which unbans all the specified members from the server
- `clear`, which clears the specified number of messages from a channel
- `setnickname`, which sets a member's nickname
- `clearnickname`, which clears all given members' nicknames

...as well as some rarer ones.
- `clearchannel`, which clears an entire channel of messages, giving you a clean slate
- `unhoistnicknames`, which sorts out those annoying hoisters

## Shine a light on you and your server.
There are plenty of detailed information commands to keep you in the know.

Again, the old timers are present:
- `userinfo`
- `serverinfo`
- `botinfo`

...as well as the new guys.
- `detailedserverinfo`
- `avatar`
- `icon`

## Plenty to look forward to.
If you liked the sound of all the above features, well, we're only just getting started. With plans to provide the ability to back up server configurations, include a dynamic warning system, and account for the most urgent situations with a lockdown system, there's a lot to keep your eyes open for!

# Cloning and running
I would greatly prefer if you invited Solaris to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=661972684153946122&scope=bot&permissions=8) rather than run your own instance. With that being said, you are able to clone Solaris to your machine in order to test it or contribute.

Solaris was also not designed with universal compatibility in mind. If you want to include sections of Solaris' code in your own program, you will likely need to make significant modifications. Make sure you abide by the terms of the license, which you can find in LICENSE.

**Note:** As of v1.0.0-rc.2, these instructions haven't been fully tested. If they are wrong, open an issue.

## Running with Docker
**Warning**: Docker functionality in Solaris was designed specifically with Debian 10 Buster in mind. If you are using another OS, you may need to modify the Dockerfile.

### Requirements
- docker
- docker-compose

### Setup
1. `cd` into the root directory (the one with this README in it).
2. Run `mkdir secrets`.
3. Create a file called "token" in the "/secrets" directory.
4. Copy and paste your bot's token into the "token" file.
5. `cd` back into the root directory.
6. Run `docker-compose build`.

**Note:** You may need to create a `[root]/solaris/data/dynamic` directory for the build to be successful.

### Running
1. `cd` into the root directory (the one with this README in it).
2. Run `docker-compose up`.
    - To run silently, use the `-d` flag.

## Running inside a virtual environment
You should be able to run Solaris using this method on any OS.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8.0 or above

### Setup
1. `cd` into the root directory (the one with this README in it).
2. Create a file called ".env" in this directory.
3. Populate the ".env" file using the following template. Note that all is here required specially don't forget to set all the emojis otherwise the bot will crash as the backup `EmojiGetter()` class hasn't been rewritten.
    ```
    TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    DEFAULT_PREFIX=">>"
    HUB_GUILD_ID=<guild id>
    HUB_COMMANDS_CHANNEL_ID=<channel id>
    HUB_RELAY_CHANNEL_ID=<channel id>
    HUB_STDOUT_CHANNEL_ID=<channel id>
    SUPPORT_GUILD_ID=<guild id>
    SUPPORT_ROLE_ID=<role id>
    ACCEPT_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    CANCEL_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    EXIT_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    INFO_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    OPTION1_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    OPTION2_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    OPTION3_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    OPTION4_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>

    PAGE_NEXT_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    STEP_BACK_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    STEP_NEXT_EMOJI_ID=<emoji id>
    ```
4. Run `py -3 -m pip install poetry`.
    - You may need to use a different `pip` command depending on your Python configuration.
5. Run `py -3 -m venv ./.venv`.
6. Run `./.venv/Scripts/activate`.
